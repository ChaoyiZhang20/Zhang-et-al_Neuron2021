
The core custom code are listed below.

1. "raster2fr.m" to transfer raw firing time stamp to firing rates
2. "wf_prop.m" to identify unit waveform property
3. "isOptoTag.m" to identify Opto-tagged neurons
4. "identifyFS.m" to identify Fast-spiking neurons.
5. "pool_stat_analysis.m" for Figure 5 and Figure 6's heatmap draw
6. "Total_ptwidthVsFr.m" for Figure 6C 
7. "Total_FrOffVsOn.m" for Figure 6E-6G
8. "plot_subtype_Frpt" for Figure S9C
9. "PV_NpHR.m" for Figure S10
